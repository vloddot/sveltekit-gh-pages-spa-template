  Since this route is "dynamic" and isn't pre-rendered, a normal SvelteKit app
  on GitHub Pages should return a 404. But what happens is that the
  <code>src/404.html</code> file gets picked up by GitHub Pages which is also
  coincidentally what the app's HTML template for SvelteKit due to changing
  <code>config.files.appTemplate</code> in <code>svelte.config.js</code>
  so GitHub Pages just simply relaunches the SvelteKit router.
